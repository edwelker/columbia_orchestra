He was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1931. After graduating from Harvard College and Tufts Medical School, he remained in Boston for four years of postgraduate radiology training. He returned to Hartford and practiced radiology until his retirement in 1986.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Through most of his life, Hurwit had been casually involved with music and composing in an unstructured manner. Since 1986 he has dedicated all of his energies to composing music. He has had no formal training, but has received informal mentoring form Robert Carl, Chairman of the Composition Department of the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford, and Michael Lankester, the former Music Director of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  In 1997 the Adaskin String Trio performed Hurwit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Adagio&rdquo; at the University of Hartford. It was then expanded into an &ldquo;Adagio for Orchestra,&rdquo; which was performed later that year by the Hartford Symphony Orchestra with Michael Lankester conducting at the Bushnell Center for Performing Arts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  After three more years of self instruction, experimentation and musical exploration Hurwit began to compose a symphony. He completed the composition of Symphony No. 1 &ldquo;Remembrance&rdquo; in 2002.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  On November 8, 9 and 10, 2002, Movement III of the symphony (electronic rendition) was choreographed by Peggy Lyman and performed by the Hartt School of Music Dancers at the Lincoln Theater of the University of Hartford.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  On February 13 and 14, 2003, the third movement of this symphony was performed in a concert world premiere by the Hartford Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Edward Cumming at the Bushnell Center for Performing Arts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  In July of 2004, the symphony was recorded by the Bulgarian National Radio Symphony Orchestra with Michael Lankester conducting. Hurwit spent eight days in Sofia and participated in the rehearsing, revisions, recording, mixing and finalizing process of the CD production. The CD of the symphony was released by MSR Classics in March of 2005, and it is being distributed by Albany Records.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The West Hartford Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Richard Chiarappa presented world premiere concert performance of the entire Symphony No.1 &ldquo;Remembrance&rdquo; on March 5, 2006.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <br />\r\n  <strong>The Results of Previous Competitions</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>2007</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"c1\">\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Winner:</strong> David Heuser: A Screaming Comes Across the Sky\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Finalists:</strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Randolph Partain: Blood Rite\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>David Sartor: Concerto for Orchestra\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Arthur Gottschalk: Amelia\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Laurence Bitensky: A Perfect Rest\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Mark Lortz: Deus Ex Machina\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Anthony Iannaccone: The Colors of Dream\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Kevin Walczyk: Capriccio\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Takuma Itoh: Concerto for Orchestra\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Lee Actor: Variations and Fugue\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>2005</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"c1\">\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Winner:</strong> David Dzubay: Shadow Dance\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Finalists:</strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Lee Actor: Prelude to a Tragedy\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Arthur Gottschalk: Amelia\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Anthony Iannaccone: The Colors of Dream\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Rob Smith: Push\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Antonio Carlos DeFeo: What's That I Hear?\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Charles Bestor: Variations for Orchestra\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Joshua Penman: Songs the Plants Taught Us\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Ernst Bacon: Smokey Mountain Scherzo\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>2003</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"c1\">\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Winner:</strong> Thomas Shnauber: Indigo Street\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    <strong>Finalists:</strong>\r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Yuanlin Chen: Overture - Rhapsody\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Paul Richards: Trip Hammer\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Stephan Prock: Garden Varieties\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Cynthia Miller: Frequent Flier\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Jeff Manookian: NEXUS\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Erich Stern: Escape\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Allen Menton: Shape-Note Fantasy\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Daniel Powers: The Starry Messenger\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>James Ra: Awakened Spirit\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Christopher Pierce: Aquarelle\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Garrett Byrnes: The Flames of Imbolc\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 9, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Contact Us", "url": "/contact_us/", "template_name": "", "sites": [1], "content": "<h2>Contact Information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  If you would like information about Columbia Orchestra events and activities, <a class=\"bodylink\" href=\"/mailing_list/\">subscribe to our mailing list</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h3>Address:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  The Columbia Orchestra\r\n  <br />\r\n  Howard County Center for the Arts\r\n  <br />\r\n  8510 High Ridge Road\r\n  <br />\r\n  Ellicott City, MD 21043\r\n</p>\r\n  <p>\r\n    Howard County Center for the Arts is a converted elementary school on the left side of High Ridge Road.

Yong Ku Ahn became the group's first Music Director and conductor in 1978.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <img src=\"/images/Orch-88.jpg\" align=\"right\" vspace=\"10\" hspace=\"10\" /> Upon Ahn's retirement in 1988, Carl Dietrich took over leadership of the orchestra. During his tenure, the membership was expanded to include winds and percussion, standard symphonic literature was programmed, and the orchestra dropped \"chamber\" from its name.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <img src=\"/images/Orch-9798.jpg\" align=\"right\" vspace=\"10\" hspace=\"10\" /> Catherine Ferguson served as the Columbia Orchestra's third Music Director from 1990 until 1999, expanding the repertoire, restructuring the annual Young Artist Competition, establishing a regular season at Howard Community College's Smith Theatre, and leading the Columbia Orchestra's first appearance at the Columbia Festival of the Arts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  <img src=\"/images/Orch-04.jpg\" align=\"right\" vspace=\"10\" hspace=\"10\" /> Current Music Director Jason Love took the podium in 1999, quickly winning the hearts of orchestra members and audience alike with his humor, generosity, and consummate musicianship. Under his baton, <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> named the Columbia Orchestra \"Howard County's premier ensemble for instrumental music.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  In August 2000, the orchestra hired Tedd Griepentrog as its first Executive Director. During the 2001-2002 season, all Masterworks programs were moved to the Jim Rouse Theatre to accommodate the expanded size of the orchestra and its growing audience. The Young People's Concert added a Musical Instrument Petting Zoo for children of all ages to see, hear, touch, and play orchestral instruments. In June 2002, the orchestra made its Kennedy Center debut in collaboration with the Tony Powell/Music & Movement dance ensemble. During its silver anniversary season, the Columbia Orchestra performed for the Maryland Music Educators Conference at the Baltimore Convention Center and announced its first biannual American Composer Competition.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  In 2005, the organization established an administrative office at the Howard County Center for the Arts and released its first commercial recording, <em>Flying Home: A Tribute to John Denver,</em> performing with members and songwriters of the original John Denver Band.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  As part of a 2006 strategic partnership with Howard Community College, the orchestra took up residency at the new Horowitz Visual and Performing Arts Center. In June 2007, the Columbia Orchestra joined with world-class fiddler Mark O'Connor for a return engagement at the Columbia Festival of the Arts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  As it enters its 31st season, the Columbia Orchestra has positioned itself for a record year of artistic and organizational accomplishments as it strives to remain \"your community's music.\"\r\n</p>", "enable_comments": false}}, {"pk": 1, "model": "flatpages.flatpage", "fields": {"registration_required": false, "title": "Mission Statement", "url": "/mission/", "template_name": "", "sites": [1], "content": "<h2>Columbia Orchestra Mission Statement</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Mission of the Columbia Orchestra is to foster lifelong appreciation of, enthusiasm for, and participation in music.
